# Phyllotaxis-Draw-Flowers-Using-Mathematics
Use R to make art and create imaginary flowers inspired by nature

## Description:
The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called phyllotaxis and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, I designed flowers using this fact.

## Project Tasks:
1. Patterns in nature
2. Draw points on a circle
3. Make it harmonious with the Golden Angle
4. Remove everything unnecessary
5. A bit of makeup: size, color and transparency
6. Create the dandelion
7. Create the sunflower
8. Modify the angle
9. Imaginary flowers
